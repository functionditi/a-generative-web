      <p>“The direction and set of instructions for creating a work of art is just as important as the art itself.” </p>
      <p>I find the way Lewitt plays with scale to be very interesting. On a tiny laptop screen, we peer into the work, but on a larger scale, it seems much more experimental and looming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like the collaborative nature of his work. The set of instructions an be executed by anyone, and the final outcomes will never be the same. There’s never a sense of finality, a full stop, and his work can live on and on. A very cool legacy to have.

      <h2>Alexei Shulgin: form</h2>

      <p>
        Shulgin’s new media art is very overwhelming: I am curious to explore, but there is no focal point so my eyes don’t know where to begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shulgin uses a set of html input elements to invoke a wry sense of humour. He creates forms using very mundane interactive elements: perhaps a sense of dadaism is invoked.
      </p>

  <p>
    I also noticed how my experience with the form art website is completely different today than it was years ago, with the visual being updated according to today’s html standards. So, how do we digitally preserve relics of the 90’s and the 2000’s without modernising it?
