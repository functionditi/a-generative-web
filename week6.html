            1 Control
           </p>
           <p>
            Who ultimately controls the game? The creator is a god and determines the parameters for the user to follow: determining what things go where and the other aspects like time, language communication as well. 
           </p>
           <p>
            The players then, are the constituents, limited by the constraints of the parameters while trying to find loopholes and establish dominance over the players. That dominance is what makes Monopoly so fun: when I managed to build hotels on the most expensive block on the board and my direct competitor lands on it, I feel like I am god’s favourite. I don’t think I’ll consider creating the rules to be as much fun. 
           </p>
           <p>
            think the control part of this intrigues me because defining the legroom I give to my users is the challenge. Do I frustrate them by giving them no leeway or bore them with endless freedom? Minecraft on Creative Mode is nowhere nearly as satisfying when playing in Survival Mode. 
           </p>
           <p>
            When I work in generative art, sometimes I find myself adding these layers of aestheticization that are tailored to my preferences: but I should probably learn to give some of the stylistic choices up and leave that to the user. I would get cooler and more varied outcomes that way.

            I like the sentence ‘designing is a continuous attempt to describe the thing to be designed’. <br><br>We’re only good designers as long as people ‘get’ our message and intention. 
  
   Out of the Reference Game and Silent game, I am drawn to the structure of the Silent game more. The reference game exists in an instructional and intent-led context while the Silent Game, to me at least, is all about demonstration, as well as communication, or the lack of it. This allows patterns to emerge (I love patterns!) What is that saying: better to do than to hear? Is that it? I don’t think that’s anything.

            3 Transformation
          </p>
          <p>
            How do we use the current elements we already have and alter it without adding/removing elements? The reading talks about mainly spatial transformation, which involves a more collborative relationship between players and the players with the designer. I also would like to think about time-based transformation and how powerless that could make us!
