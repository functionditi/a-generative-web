         <p>
           Lawrence Weiner's first artist book with seemingly neutral statements that otherwise ring of instruction, or an invitation to actualize and materialize the projected work.

            Weiner, along with artists Sol Lewitt, Robert Barry, and Joseph Kosuth, is best known for his text-based artworks and installations and was among some of the first artists to slowly shift the object of art into an aesthetic that was purely language-based.</p>

            <p>
              The book consisted of 24 typed processes that one needed to follow to produce art, with Weiner using words and descriptions written in the past participle that were clear but not too direct, suggesting that an artwork’s existence required a readership as opposed to a material presence.

            Weiner demonstrated that for his art pieces to be created, the lettering did not necessarily need to be done by himself. As long as the painter adhered to the instructions dictated by Weiner, his pieces would come into existence. The development of Weiner’s artistic style focused on the possibility for language to exist as an art form by itself, with the addition of materials considered less important.

            I find this interesting because design is a largely synergic medium, and by using language combined with materiality and visualisation, the artist and the participant are able to create something more meanigful and unique.
