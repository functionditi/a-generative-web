            Reading 'Jodi's Infrastructure'by A. R. Galloway, I am reminded of the 'Duck' vs 'Decorated Shed' argument presented in Venturi and Scott Brown's architectural book, 'Learning from Las Vegas'. There, the pressing issue centered around form, medium and decoration, and the idea that the message is the medium.

            This made me think about how I percieve myself as a computational artist who tends to work on the web. (Or in the web?) I guess I hold a modernist perspective, then, since I defaulted to the idea of 'on' rather than 'in.' Am I modernist?

            I wonder why the concept of digitality and working on it as a medium interests me. Perhaps it's the perpetuality of it: stuff can exist in multiples, on different desktops and laptops, simultaneously, while something more tactile requires a little more effort. I like the flexibility of it all, as well, which is also touched upon in the article: deleting is easy, and covering up my mistakes can happen at the push of a button. I like the fact that whatever's on the web exists as a trace and I am never reminded of its presence due to the lack of tangibility.
